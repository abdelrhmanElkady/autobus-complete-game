# How To Play
The rules of this game are simple:- players try to write names for the above things starting with that letter. The first one who finishes them all says "autobus complete" and everyone leaves the pens.- Then they all together say everthing they wrote in each column. If two or more people write the same name, take 5 marks for it. If they don't, take 10 marks. Add them together and write the number in the points coloumn and so on until they finishe the time (depends on the players).- So everyone adds his results for each letter together and the one who gets the high number he is the winner.
